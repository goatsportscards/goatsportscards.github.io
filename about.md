## Welcome, fellow sports fanatic!

My name is Domenic Fayad and Goat.SportsCards is the the convergence of my two favourite hobbies: analytics and sports cards.

My goal is to grow this amazing hobby and to empower collectors and investors from all places to make data-driven decisions.     

## A Collector First

The first sports cards pack that I ever ripped was a pack of 2005-06 Upper Deck Black Diamond. Even though I had been collecting Pokemon since the early 2000s, my attention shifted to hockey cards after NHL rookie superstars Sidney Crosby & Alexander Ovechkin took the league by storm after the 2004 lockout year. 

Nothing will ever replace the nostalgic feeling of opening up a pack of cards. However, these days I prefer buying what I'm after.
